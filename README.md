# BearOrBull

## Description:
  As I have developed stronger interests towards personal investing. In this project, I am attempting to create a website application that works as a "Rotten Tomatoes" for the US Stock Exchange. Using the terms common within the trading, "Bearish" and "Bullish", I want to create a platform for passionate stock investors to receive real critic advice while being able to give their own input. This website and applications will be called "Bear or Bull".
